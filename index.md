<p align="justify">My name is Janine George and I am currently a postdoc at the <a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html">Universit√© catholique de Louvain</a>. On this website, you will find information on my person and my research. My current research focuses on coordination environments within crystal structures, data analysis and high-throughput computing for materials discovery. My research during my PhD focused on molecular crystals, their intermolecular interactions, and their thermal motion.

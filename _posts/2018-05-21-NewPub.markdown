The synthesis of chloro formamidinium chloride has been  known  for  over  one  century. However,  no  solid-state  structure  of  a chlorine-substituted formamidinium compound has been reported up to now.  In this contribution, the  syntheses,  solid-state  structures, and vibrational  properties  of  four  chloro  formamidinium  compounds are described.

In the course of 2020, Dr. Markus Suta and I have written five articles on topics from inorganic chemistry for "Blickpunkt Anorganik" in the "Nachrichten aus der Chemie" (members' journal of the German Chemical Society).

*In the first article, we looked at machine learning and data science for discovering new inorganic materials.

*The second article deals with the recipe for narrow-band phosphors.

*In the third article, we described how high-throughput studies based on ab initio calculations can be used for the discovery of new materials and understanding properties of materials.

*In the fourth article, we looked at how temperature can be measured with light.

*The fifth article was mainly written by Jun-Prof. Helge Stein (KIT). This article covers automated materials synthesis to accelerate the discovery of new materials.

We have recently published "High-throughput computational discovery of In2Mn2O7 as a high Curie temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor for spintronics" in npj Computational Materials. We search for new ferromagnetic semiconductors that can be used in spintronics such as spin filter. Besides the fact that good semiconducting properties are rare for ferromagnetic materials, these materials face also other challenges: they are typically also very sensitive to oxidation and show a low Curie temperatures which complicates their application in devices. In2Mn2O7 is predicted to be a good semiconductor, a high Curie temperature ferromagnetic material, stable towards oxidation. It is identified starting from 40.000 materials in the Materials Project database.

We have assessed the predictive power of the Pauling Rules: they only work for less than 80% of all tested oxides. The paper is out in Angewandte Chemie ([http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.202000829](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.202000829)) and the study was discussed by Chemistry World ([see here](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/textbook-structure-rules-formulated-by-linus-pauling-90-years-ago-prove-unreliable/4011236.article)).
